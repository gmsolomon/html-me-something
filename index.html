                My passion for scrapbooking began 19 years ago with the birth of my first child. At that time, my only option for supplies was Creative
                Memories. Things sure have changed since then.
                I now have six children and I have switched from creating traditional scrapbook pages to digital ones. When I switched to digital scrapbooking, about ten years ago, my love for scrapbooking exploded.<br/>

                It seems like I am always working on a baby album. I'm always looking for new ideas. There are many great scrapbook websites out there, but I found it difficult to sift through all the sample layouts to find ideas for creating baby pages.

                So, I thought it would be a great idea to have a website dedicated to creating baby memory books. A place where we can come together to share ideas and encourage one another to remember those Tiny Toes Forever. <br><br>

                 This is one of my favorite scrapbook pages that I have made. I wanted it to look like I had pictures and sketches scattered
                 across my table. I used Photoshop and converted my son's pictues into sketches. Then, I shrunk downd the photos and attached
                 them to the sketches with digital paper clips.

                Creating a scrapbook using ultrasound photos is always a bit challenging. I made this page for my sister. I had a very dark image
                of her when she was in labor. I took that photo and cut out her silhouette. I then transformed it in Photoshop using some metallic
                filters. I layered the ultrasound photos under her picture ans erased part of her image to make it look like we are peeking
                into the womb.

                I had fun making this page of my son learning how to crawl. I took several photos of him at eye level. Then I used Photoshop
                to cut out his silhouette. I placed the cut-out pictures of him across the front of page.
